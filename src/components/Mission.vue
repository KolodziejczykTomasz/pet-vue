          <div class="mission__description">A healthy microbiota is crucial for the proper development and
            function of the intestines of dogs and cats. Bacteria that live in the intestine perform a number of
            important functions. Their role is primarily to support digestive processes,
            nourish the intestinal epithelium, produce short-chain fatty acids, synthesize vitamins and regulate
            the immune system.
